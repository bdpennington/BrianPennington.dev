# Slide Decks

## Overview

This is a place for me to upload a variety of slide decks I've used as teaching materials. I'll add more as I create new ones or revamp existing ones.

<!-- ::: tip
When viewing slides, you can enter presenter mode (and see presenter notes) by hovering your mouse over the bottom-left part of the screen to reveal the slide navigation, then click on the icon that looks like a person with a microphone.
