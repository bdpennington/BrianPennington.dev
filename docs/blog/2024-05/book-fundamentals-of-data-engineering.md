# Book Review: Fundamentals of Data Engineering

Just finished "Fundamentals of Data Engineer" by Joe Reis and Matt Housley, and it was a banger.

I've seen this book referenced countless times in the last couple years on my feeds, but always filed it away in the back of my mind as "maybe at some point in the future" reading material.

Well, the future arrived, and as I found myself increasingly in need of more complex data architecture to feed my ML habit and SRE-related responsibilities, I did a little research and decided to pick it up.

Let me tell you: this book is dense. Really dense. The breadth of experience within is clearly evident, well-organized, and very approachable.

The authors take you a 50,000 ft journey of the data engineering landscape, occasionally taking short dives into specific architectural setups to explain concepts in more detail.

This is not a how-to book in the sense that they tell you what services and pieces of software to string together with what configurations, but rather, it intentionally avoids going into any depth on any given technology in order to describe the entire landscape that encompasses a data engineer's work.

The primary topic of the book is the "data engineering lifecycle," which as the name implies, breaks up the flow of data into semantic, digestible concepts -- ingestion, storage, transformation, and serving data.

This is also not a theory book -- it focuses intensely on the reality of building data systems within the context of a business. To name a few: the financial impact of data systems on a business (including common pitfalls); the common purposes and use-cases for data systems and how to think about them; who you'll work with as a data engineer and the various undercurrents of those relationships.

This book has already helped me figure out strategies to deal with a number of hurdles I've been facing with various performance bottlenecks (and I don't just mean indexing) and has given me the means to start to put together systems for managing data for ML and service monitoring systems (operational analytics, as they call it).

If you're an aspiring data engineer, or even an experienced one, or in a related field like data science, give this book a read. It'll open your eyes to what's possible, and as it did for me, give you the means to start building the things you want to build.
