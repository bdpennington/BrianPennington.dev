features:
  - title: Raising All Boats
    details: |
      When others do well, I do well. I love learning and teaching others the fruits of that labor.
      <br><br>
      I feel that creating institutionalized knowledge is one of the most effective ways to build great teams.
  - title: A Dog Will Hunt
    details: |
      If I'm interested in something, I am deeply driven to understand that something.
      <br><br>
      Experimentation, writing, and collaboration make up the basis for how I discover real needs and solutions.
  - title: UX Driven Development
    details: I believe creating intuitive interfaces and maximizing utility for users starts with making UX, accessibility, and performance the foundations of the development process.
  - title: The Winning Team
    details: |
      I'm a big believer in creating and working with small, self-organized, cross-functional teams.
      <br><br>
      This includes business stakeholders as fist-class members to represent the business' needs and goals.
  - title: Got Feedback?
    details: |
      Proponent of creating feedback mechanisms throughout the product value pipeline, including product, design, and support teams -- and of course, the end users.
      <br><br>
      This is required to ensure the product that gets built is the product the business wants, and is the product the users need.
  - title: DX and Automation
    details: |
      Create and utilize great tooling to automate all the repetitive stuff, including CI/CD pipelines, utility/ui-kit libraries to save developers from writing the same code over and over (usually in slightly different ways).
      <br><br>
      These tools should be treated as internal products that should meet the same standards as the business' products.
